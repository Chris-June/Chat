Your task is to generate three announcements for the launch of a new AI-powered productivity app called 'CogniFlow'.

Generate one post for each of the following platforms: Twitter, LinkedIn, and a short blog post.

- The Twitter post should be concise (under 280 chars), use 2-3 relevant hashtags, and have a high-energy tone.
- The LinkedIn post should be professional, focus on productivity benefits for teams, and be around 3-4 sentences.
- The blog post should be a 3-paragraph announcement explaining what CogniFlow is, its top 3 features (intelligent sorting, task automation, and collaborative workspaces), and who it's for (students, professionals, and teams).

Ensure all posts are factual and avoid making exaggerated claims about the AI's capabilities.`;
