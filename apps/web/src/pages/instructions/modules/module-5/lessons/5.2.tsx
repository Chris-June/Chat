        A generic AI is like a hotel receptionistâ€”helpful, but formal. A *personalized* AI is like a personal concierge who knows your preferences, remembers your past requests, and anticipates your needs. This lesson is about transforming your AI from a receptionist into a world-class concierge by mastering **static** and **dynamic context**.
