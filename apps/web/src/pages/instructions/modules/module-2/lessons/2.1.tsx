      correctAnswer: 'The oldest messages are \'forgotten\' to make room for new ones.',

        Have you ever had a conversation where you had to keep repeating yourself? It's frustrating. The same is true when talking to an AI. The key to a smooth, intelligent conversation is understanding and managing its 'memory'â€”what we call the <strong>context window</strong>.

          What is a Context Window?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4 max-w-prose">
          Think of the context window as the AI's short-term memory. It's a finite space that holds the recent back-and-forth of your conversation. Every time you send a message, the entire history is sent to the AI. This history is called the 'context'.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4 max-w-prose">
          Below is a live AI chat. As you interact with it, you can see the 'Live Context' on the right update in real-time. This is the actual array of messages being sent to the AI with every single request. This is the AI's 'memory' of your conversation. The more you chat, the larger this context grows.

        'The AI has a limited "working memory" (context window) that fills up like a whiteboard',
        'When memory is full, the oldest parts of your conversation are "forgotten"',
        'You can manage this by summarizing important details in long conversations',
        'Short conversations (under ~10 messages) rarely have memory issues',
        'If the AI seems confused, gently remind it of key details from earlier'
