1. **Hypothesis Formulation**: Help them state a clear, testable hypothesis (e.g., "By changing X, we will improve Y, because Z.").
2. **Metric Definition**: Help them define a single, key metric to measure the change (e.g., "User satisfaction score," "Correction rate," "Task completion time").
3. **A/B Test Design**: Help them outline a simple A/B test (e.g., "Group A gets the old prompt, Group B gets the new prompt. We will compare the key metric between the two groups after 1,000 interactions.").
Be encouraging and help them think critically about their ideas.`;

        Building an AI product isn't a one-time event; it's a continuous cycle of learning and refinement. Iterative improvement is the process of using data and user feedback to make your product better over time.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-blue-300">The Cycle of AI Improvement</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6">Great AI products evolve. The key is a tight feedback loop: measure what matters, test your assumptions, and learn from the results.</p>
        <div className="space-y-6">
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white flex items-center"><BarChart2 className="w-6 h-6 mr-2 text-green-400" />1. Measure What Matters</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400 mt-2">Don't just track clicks. For AI products, focus on metrics that signal quality and trust. First, define your product's "golden path"â€”the ideal journey for a user. Then, measure things like:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 text-gray-300 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Correction Rate:</strong> How often do users have to edit the AI's output? A high rate might signal prompt or model issues.</li>
              <li><strong>Tool Adoption:</strong> If your AI uses tools, which ones are users adopting? Which are being ignored?</li>
              <li><strong>User Satisfaction:</strong> A simple thumbs up/down on an AI response is a powerful signal.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white flex items-center"><Beaker className="w-6 h-6 mr-2 text-yellow-400" />2. A/B Test Your Prompts</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400 mt-2">The easiest thing to change in an AI product is the prompt. Use A/B testing to see which prompts yield better results against your key metrics.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-400 mt-2"><strong>Example Test:</strong> For an email-writing AI, you could test Prompt A: "Write a professional email" vs. Prompt B: "Write a polite but firm follow-up email."</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white flex items-center"><RefreshCw className="w-6 h-6 mr-2 text-cyan-400" />3. Learn and Adapt</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400 mt-2">Use the data from your measurements and tests to make decisions. If users constantly correct the AI's tone, maybe your prompt needs to be more specific. If a feature isn't being used, maybe it's not as useful as you thought. This data is your guide to what to build or refine next.</p>

          A good experiment starts with a clear hypothesis. Use the chat window below to improve an AI feature. Describe the feature, and the AI will help you formulate a testable hypothesis, define a key metric, and create an A/B test to see if your change works.
