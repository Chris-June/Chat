          Building a tool for an AI is like creating a new appliance for a smart kitchen. The AI (the chef) needs to know what the appliance does, what ingredients it needs, and what it produces. Let's walk through the process of designing a tool from scratch.

          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Before you write any code, clearly define what your tool will do. Be specific. A tool to "handle food" is too vague. A tool to "order a pizza" is much better. It should have a single, well-defined purpose.
          </p>

              <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Order a pizza for delivery.</li>
              <li><strong>Ingredients (Inputs):</strong> It needs to know the `size` and `toppings`.</li>
              <li><strong>Result (Output):</strong> It should return a `confirmation_number`.</li>

            Think of the schema as a detailed recipe card for your AI chef. Just like a recipe needs precise instructions ("add 2 cups of flour"), your tool schema needs crystal-clear descriptions for each parameter. The AI chef can't guess what "some flour" means - it needs exact measurements and specific instructions.
