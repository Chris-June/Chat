        <p className="text-gray-300">
          We've learned about function calling, MCP, custom tools, and GPTs. Now, we put it all together. An <strong>AI Agent</strong> is what you get when you give a model a goal, a set of tools, and the autonomy to decide how to use them to achieve that goal.
        </p>
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Agent Anatomy: A Deep-Dive" icon={<Bot />}>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Under the hood, most agents are built from four key components working in concert. Understanding this 'anatomy' is the first step to designing your own effective agents.

        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          The key difference is proactivity. While a standard model waits for your command, an agent operates on a continuous loop:

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-white mb-2">The Loop in Action</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">Let's imagine an agent whose goal is: `Resolve support ticket #123`.</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3 text-gray-300">
            <li>
              <strong>Observe:</strong> The agent starts with the initial state. `Current State: Unresolved ticket #123.`
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Think:</strong> The agent reasons, `To resolve the ticket, I first need to understand the problem. I should use the 'get_ticket_details' tool.`
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Act:</strong> The agent executes `get_ticket_details(ticket_id='123')` and gets a result: `{'{"details": "User cannot log in."}'}`.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Observe (Loop 2):</strong> The agent updates its state. `Current State: Ticket #123 is a login issue.`
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Think (Loop 2):</strong> The agent reasons, `Login issues are often caused by server errors. I should check the server logs.`
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Act (Loop 2):</strong> The agent executes `search_server_logs(query='login error')`...
            </li>

        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Many modern agents use a framework called <strong>ReAct</strong>. It's a simple but powerful idea: at each step, the agent first 'thinks' (reasons) about what to do next and then 'acts' by choosing a tool. This makes the agent's behavior transparent and easier to debug.
