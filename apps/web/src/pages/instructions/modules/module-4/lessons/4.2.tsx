      ],
      correctAnswer: 'To give the AI a standard way to discover and use external tools and APIs.',
      explanation: 'MCP provides a standardized interface, like a universal remote, allowing the AI to interact with many different tools without needing to know their internal workings.'

      options: [
        'There is no difference.',
        'With MCP, the AI can discover tools dynamically, whereas basic function calling uses hard-coded tools.',

      correctAnswer: 'With MCP, the AI can discover tools dynamically, whereas basic function calling uses hard-coded tools.',

      ],
      correctAnswer: 'It asks the server, \'What skills do you have?\' (i.e., it makes a discovery request).',

          Imagine an AI like a smart assistant (e.g., Siri or Alexa). By itself, it knows a lot, but it can't interact with the outside world. MCP gives it superpowers by letting it use external "skills" or "apps."
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
          <li>An <strong>MCP Server</strong> is like a skill store (e.g., the Spotify app).</li>

          The AI doesn't need to know *how* the Spotify code works. It just needs to know the skill exists and how to ask it to play a song. MCP is the standard language it uses to make that request.
